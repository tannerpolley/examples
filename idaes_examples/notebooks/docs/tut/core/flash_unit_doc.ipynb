This is essentially giving the solver an initial guess for the iterative solver to reach convergence and is essential for both a fast and accurate solution. In IDAES, the current standard for initializing the model is by utilizing initializer instances. These initializer instances contain the initialize method that can be applied to any model type. For more information on initializing in IDAES, visit https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference_guides/initialization/index.html. <br>\n",

This is often the simplest way to obtain a compatible initializer for each unit model, but you can also directly important any initializer needed from this source `idaes.core.initialization`. Each initializer instance contains the `initialize()` method that requires an argument to be initialized and in this case its the flash unit model.\n"
